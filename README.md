About Me
  - [picture]
  - Bio
      I just graduated from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, a 12-week full-time bootcamp designed to stuff as much practical web dev knowledge as can fit into its students' brains. I've been dabbling in HTML/CSS/Wordpress designs since I was in middle school, so I was delighted to finally dive into web development head-on. I have learned an amazing amount in three months, and while I know I have much more to tackle, I’m excited to go out and put my knowledge to use improving the Web.

    This is me cracking my knuckles, eager to get started!


    My skills:

    HTML5 CSS3 JavaScript
    Git / GitHub
    MongoDB / Mongoose Express Node.js Angular.js
    Ruby / Ruby on Rails PostgreSQL

    Other Tools:
    Bootstrap, Stripe API, Ace
    Jade, Stylus, Jasmine
    Heroku, MongoLab
    Photoshop and basic image editing, basic graphic design
    (+ WordPress, [in-company] Content Management Systems)

    What I'm Looking For

    - A junior web development position, either full stack or front end, in a team with good mentorship and steady opportunities to try new things.
